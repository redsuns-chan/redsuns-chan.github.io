            <p>
                I'm a software engineer in Hong Kong.
                I have worked in multiple MNC companies to develop large-scale projects with modern web technologies.
                Working in a team with an agile development process to create new features and enhance the existing system is a daily of my job.
                <br></br>
                I keep looking for opportunities to enhance my development and cooperation skills. Please contact me through Linkedin if you want to give me a chance to join your team!
